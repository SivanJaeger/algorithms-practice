# Algorithms Practice

This repository will include implementations of common algorithms and data structures in **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of algorithmic efficiency and problem-solving through practice and experimentation.

Topics planned:
- Sorting and Searching
- Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Complexity Analysis
